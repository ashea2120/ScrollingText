---
This repository is for Lab 1 submission.
 
## 1.1 Android Studio and Scrolling Text
 
This particular project focused around text and scrolling views and added them to an article that was found on the website. 
 
## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
 
- Added a ScrollView and learned how to implement them in the XML file. 
- Enabled more than one TextView component to scroll
- Learned how to add a web url to an app and have it navigate a user to a website
- Two of my TextView elements towards the top that were the heading and subheading were "see-through" and the scrolling text could be read through it. Not too sure on how to make it non-transparent.
